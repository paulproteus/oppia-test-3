          <p>         
            If a change is requested, and we agree that it needs doing, this is what we're likely to do:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If it's an obvious fix, we'll fix it as soon as possible. You'll see this occur via a change in the codebase.
              </li>
              <li>
                If it needs more thought and cannot be done immediately, we might translate it into one or more bugs and put them on our <a href="https://code.google.com/p/oppia/issues/list">bug tracker</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            If, within a few days, you don't see any changes made or new issues filed, please get in touch via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia">discussion group</a> or the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/oppia/issues/list">bug tracker</a>. This makes it possible for us to respond directly to the issue.
