    value: All right! So you think there are {{answer}} ways to arrange the balls.
      Could you list them?<div><br></div><div>Let's say one ball is red, one ball
      is blue, and one ball is yellow. So you could represent one of the arrangements
      as:</div><div><ul><li>RBY</li></ul><div>This means that the red ball is on the
      left, the blue ball is in the middle, and the yellow ball is on the right. What
      are the other ways?</div></div>

        - 'What? No more ways? There''s at least one, surely -- for example, RYB.
          Or maybe you clicked the ''Submit'' button before you clicked the ''Add
          element'' button. You''ll need to build up the set first, and then, once
          you''re happy with your answer, click Submit.'
